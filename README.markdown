This is a plain WinAPI program written using GDI+.  Runs on Windows XP or
newer.

If you don't have a copy of Visual Studio already installed, the easiest
way to build this program yourself is to download and install Microsoft
Visual C++ 2010 Express Edition:

Building this project does not require any Visual Studio features or APIs
(such as MFC or ATL) not available in the free version of Visual C++.
